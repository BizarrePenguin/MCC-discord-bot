# Minecraft-Console-Client â†” Discord

This little project is a discord bot written in python that acts as an interface for one or multiple instances of [minecraft console client](https://github.com/MCCTeam/Minecraft-Console-Client), which is abbreviated "MCC".

Basically this bot should be installed on a host machine with the MCC installed, so all members of the discord server where the bot is invited to, have an easy and safe access to a preconfigured MCC. This can be used mainly for a convenient method of AFK support without much technical knowledge of the server members that want to AFK without leaving their personal computers on.
